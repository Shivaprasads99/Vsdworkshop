# Vsdworkshop
Starting with Picorv32a Design example

Physical Design or PnR (Place and Route) is the core of any IC design cycle. From a RTL netlist to final tape-out, each phase of PnR brings it’s own challenges and surprises. “What are these challenges?” “What is the process?” “Can I build a chip of my own?”- If you have these questions and if you are eager to delve into the world of ASIC design flow..Wait no more!

With the announcement of Google-SkyWater’s first manufacturable open source 130nm process design kit (pdk), open source EDA world is no longer limited in scope to academic research and small scale projects only. This along with the conception of Openlane flow, a fully-automated RTL2GDSII flow, has made the dream of “an IC for all” a near reality.
So here’s announcing the ultimate workshop on SoC design planning in Openlane flow using the latest Google-SkyWater 130nm process node.
So if you want to –

Design and characterize your own standard cell.
Have a hands-on in the Physical Design domain.
Generate a full GDSII from a RTL netlist.
Explore and contribute to open source EDA world.

This is the opportunity for you!!
